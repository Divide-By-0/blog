Thought it would be fun to share useful things that I've bought for myself, as inspired by [Andrew Connor](https://andrewconner.com/things/), [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/tools-gear/), and nudging from [Vivek](https://twitter.com/viv_boop). Most other lists online are more comprehensive and I have taken many things from them. Most stuff is from Amazon (linked via short reflinks, but I still link to the cheapest version + only stuff I would have linked without that). I want to add software here soon.

This alive document will be updated every time I buy something incredible.

# Household

**[Molly's Suds Laundry Detergent Pods](https://amzn.to/3oznUYk) - $20.** Cheaper than tide pods. A little worried about [normal detergent inflamming my allergies/EoE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35899466/) so I decided to move away from standard detergent.
**[Heated Japanese Kotatsu Table](https://amzn.to/3oupdYp) + [300W Adapter](https://amzn.to/3AflFvx) - $200.** Imagine a table with a heater inside and a comforter around it, but a flat surface to work on. It's incredibly warm and cozy, especially in the winter. Takes a few weeks to ship from Japan, but is totally worth it.
**[Chromecast](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&_nkw=chromecast&_sacat=0) - $30**. Only really useful to keep TV on ambient mode, flipping through Google Photos albums of me and all of my friends.

# Bathroom

**[Mint Shampoo and Conditioner](https://amzn.to/3MXzOVZ) - $23.** Spent way too long finding hair products that were SLS-free, EWG-approved, and smelled good.
**[Body Wash](https://amzn.to/3ox6j35) - $9.** Smells good, doesn't have SLS or other crap in it.
**[The Softest Bathroom Mats](https://amzn.to/40pgfcg) - $20.** High pile and insanely soft and plush.
**[Snail Trail Bee Venom Face Moisturizer](https://amzn.to/3AiZx3I) - $25.** It just feels soo good. Reddit recommended.
**[Double Line Floss Picks](https://amzn.to/3oyc6oS) - $3.** These make flossing fun and are useful on the go -- it's super easy to grab on your way out, and the gunk comes out stick between the two strings. Normal floss cuts off circulation to my finger and so I never do it.
**[Sekkisui Face Sunscreen](https://www.ebay.com/itm/323874987084?hash=item4b68741c4c:g:oKkAAOSwrHRdRLKA) - $20.** Non greasy, nice smelling, easy to apply sunscreen from /r/AsianBeauty. Other folks recommend Biore UV which I'm sure is good as well.

# Kitchen

**[Water Bottle Cleaning Tablets](https://amzn.to/3An9LQh) - $8.** Put into your water bottle for 15 min to clean out the gunk.
**[Dishwand](https://amzn.to/3KYDxQm) - $4.** Basicallly a sponge with a handle. sPut dishsoap onto it to clean dishes without having to touch a sponge.
**[Creme Brulee Torch](https://amzn.to/3UWvcBy) + [Fuel](https://amzn.to/3ox5fMJ) - $16.** Way more fun than a lighter or matchbox.
**[Ramen Bowls](https://amzn.to/3AeNuEo) - $40.** Spark joy, useful for most soupy foods.

I also use Athletic Greens each morning and have gazpacho in the fridge for a quick breakfast. I hate cooking and use a rotation of microwavable frozen food delivery services to eat (I promise it's less depressing and more tasty than it sounds).

# Clothing

**[Enro Face Masks](https://enro.com/collections/adults) - $20**. [Wirecutter tested](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-cloth-face-masks/) face masks for filtration and comfort, and this won both hands down. It claims a PM0.1 filter, and tests consistently with that as well; it also maintains it for a few washes (but becomes half as effective at 50 washes; I usually lose mine before 10). I use it in any place with asbestos risk as well; it's not a cure-all but it's better than any other mask for that.
**[Shirt Stays](https://amzn.to/3N23Ckf) - $13.** Connect your dress shirt to your socks. Critical for formal dress shirts for me, to avoid it bunching up and look bad.
**[Neck Gaiter](https://amzn.to/43PkT68) - $15.** Tighter and smaller than a scarf, critical in cold weather.

# Backpack

**[Sidecar iPad Mount for Laptop](https://amzn.to/3L23EpQ) - $35.** Lets you mount your iPad on the side of your laptop as an extended display. Useful for traveling without a monitor. Shoutout to [Vivek](https://twitter.com/viv_boop) for the rec.
**[Contoured Ear Plugs](https://amzn.to/3KUaSMu) - $18.** Normal earplugs don't fit me that well. These fall out every now and then, but I only need them to fall asleep so it's OK.
**[Mini Sim + Cable Box](https://amzn.to/40sX8Ov) - $10.** Has a SIM switcher, and small adapters nicely laid out. I carry this with a few USB to USB C adapters seperately.
**[Beaded Laptop Wrist Rest](https://amzn.to/3KUfsdA) - $20.** More comfortable for wrists on laptop + I used early in carpal tunnel journey before I discovered Sarno, and now I can't type without them.
**[Bose 700 Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xlaptop+stand.TRS0&_nkw=bose+700&_sacat=0) - $200.** Can pair to my phone and laptop at once, USB-C charging, excellent active noise cancellation. Bought on eBay for a discount, I love my Eclipse colorway.

I also have an iPad for notes, and a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for distraction-free books. I use Calibre on my laptop to format and load in arbitrary epubs and mobis from online. I also use

# Other

**[Proxmark 3 RFID Cloner](https://amzn.to/3GZSBfo) - $75.** Designed by the veritable and prolific [Samy Kamkar](https://twitter.com/samykamkar). Can be a bit finnicky to first time setup, but once you have it then it clones basically all cards I throw at it.
**[RFID Ring](https://amzn.to/3AhjojO) - $30.** Clone any card onto this, then just tap with your finger to use it.
**[Extremely Small Wallet Pen](https://amzn.to/41DjNJ2) - $7.** This ~1mm wide, ~4 inch pen fits in my wallet and is useful in a pinch or when geocaching.
**[Heated Eye Mask](https://amzn.to/3MWPUiF) - $17.** Plugs into a USB, very useful for dry eye.
**[Cheap Apple Pencil 2](https://amzn.to/43QyWbt) - $30.** Give up variable pressure and pay 5x less, still magnetically charges.

# Fun

**[Colored Flame Birthday Candles](https://amzn.to/41qsCGh) - $7.** Cheap, simple, and cool on birthdays.
**[Joycon Controller Grips](https://amzn.to/3AgnbO9)- $10.** Turn each Nintendo Switch joycon into a mini controller.
**[Under the Door Tool](https://lockpicktools.com/under-the-door-tool/) - $35.** Open any door. Useful to retrofit with a hook for some handles.

My favorite board games are Decrypto (a way better alternative to Codenames), Smallworld (sort of like Risk but more fun), and Hanabi (team communication game). I've been recommended Paleo, Terraforming Mars, Forbidden Desert, Cascadia, Fort, and 7 Wonders but haven't tried them.

# Small PC Build

**[32GB DDR5 RAM](https://amzn.to/41ISugm) - $80.** Standard RAM.
**[Mini ITX Motherboard](https://amzn.to/3GWQ7OL) - $200.** This is what will determine if you have a small (ITX), medium (ATX) or big PC.
**[SF750 Power Supply](https://amzn.to/41ovLXd) - $165.** Enough to comfortably run a high end GPU with everything else.
**[i5 12400F IBM CPU](https://amzn.to/3MXDiI3) - $160.** You are optimizing for heat; the bigger and later gen CPUs run hotter, and this is extremely fast, better than lower tier i7s, and doesn't need any extra cooling.
**[2TB NVMe](https://amzn.to/3LkgG3j) - $140.** Faster and cheaper than an SSD.

I also use a 3060TI and a Dan A4 Case. [Build video and more detailed part breakdowns here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNvCDBKa5C32xioyYf02mZgIgCG_GFZHWnw0rGWRPzs/edit).
