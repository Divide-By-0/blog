It's hard to find a curated list of movies that I or my friends would like. I usually get my movies from the Cannes Film Festival winners, or the A24 trailers, or from the IMDb top movies, or from the Oscar nominees, or my friends -- even then, it's hard to isolate why people like specific movies. Personal recommendations are rare and treasured, and I wish there was a place that all my friends put their favorite movies up so I could steal from that list instead. I like international movies especially, since they aren't influenced by the usual Hollywood tropes or methods of storytelling and tend to be a lot more unique.

Specifically, I love movies that are more sci-fi in nature (like Dune), or have a complex plot that takes focus to fully understand (ahem Tenet), or make you feel a ton of emotions (like Better Days), or have you sniff out lots of little clues that the filmmaker plants (I love huge retcons, e.g. Us). Specifically, I think more technical folks or people who love puzzles, will particularly love this list! I don't include any spoilers, but more of a broadstrokes review. This list is largely inspired by [Nick Sweeting's similar list](https://docs.sweeting.me/s/movies-to-watch). If you have any recs for me having looked at this list, I'd love to hear them -- you can dm me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yush_g/)!

## Previous

### 2022

- **Better Days**: 10/10. Wholesome coming of age romance story. Starts with bullying, but evolves into a way more complex and emotional story. Was censored by the CCP, so there are a few scenes that don't make 100% sense, but [a few articles](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/inside-the-censorship-battle-over-oscar-nominee-better-days-it-was-a-tug-of-war-4165587/) quickly cleared it up. Some trailers have previews of some of the cut scenes too. First Academy Award nominated film from Hong Kong director. Had me thinking about the film for like a whole day after.

- **3 Idiots**: 10/10. Rewatched this after 10 years. This is my favorite Bollywood film of all time; a touching story told through an educational satire. Has some legendary songs and probably shaped a good amount of my young identity.

- **Clue**: 9/10. Really incredible adaptation (of the board game!). Probably my favorite movie pre-1990, they did a great job making murder lighthearted and keeping the audience guessing.

- **Howl's Moving Castle**: 10/10. My first Studio Ghibli film. Incredible character design, animation, and story.

- **Nope**: 6/10. I had high hopes for a Jordan Peele film after **Us** topped my 2020 list, but was let down. This film explored spectacle and animal treatment, themes that I think made for less complex plots. It was cool though how two seemingly disparate plots connected in ways that implied non-obvious subtexts about each one. The movie theatre itself was absolutely sick though -- Nitehawk Cinema in NYC; they serve you food and drinks in your seat!

- **Hadestown**: 10/10. Broadway musical to not technically a movie. Best play I've seen since Hamilton -- the music, the story, the acting, the characters, the set: everything really stood out and made you tear up at the end.

- **jeen-yuhs**: 9/10. (rated before Kanye got cancelled) This man was such a lunatic that before his first album, he got a documentary videogapher to follow him around. As a result, there's a ton of crazy primary source footage, and a really compelling narrative that colors in a lot of what did and didn't change with Donda around. Only really recommended for Kanye fans.

- **Look at Me**: 8/10. Another documentary that fills in the troubled story of the most-streamed hip hop artist of our generation. It's crazy to see this mans electric stage presence from the very first show. He was a complex person, and the documentary managed to both give a fair portrayal of his crimes and explain the circumstances that led to it. I wish we could have seen him live out the redemption arc that the movie painted, but maybe he never would have. Again, only highly recommended for fans of his music.

- **3 Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri**: 10/10.

- **Arrival**: 7/10. While the visuals put it a notch above the book, I thought the movie editorialization from the book to add a “reason” for the events hurt the story. Isn’t selflessness more romantic and idealistic?

- **Badla**: 9/10. This is a more recent Hindi film about a surprisingly well-told mystery — I won’t spoil it, but I found the story more refreshing than any other previous mystery movie I’ve watched (it was way better than Knives Out). It’s the fourth foreign language remake of a similar Spanish mystery movie, The Innocent Guest, so you can rewatch in different languages!

- **Ek Tha Tiger**: 4/10. Classic feel-good action/romance Hindi film about the spy that falls in love. I thought the message was pretty standard and some of the reveals were fairly predictable so wouldn’t recommend it, but it’s a nice feeling to be able to recognize and predict tropes sometimes!

- **Tick Tick Boom**: 9/10. This year’s Lin Manuel Miranda release. The relationship dialogue felt really authentic, and it’s really fun to see the maturation of the character's vision throughout time. Confused how 30/90 is the most popular song from the album, I put it dead last on my ranking. Alexandra Shipp is my newest celeb crush for sure.

- **Tenet**: 10/10. On the first watch, I was unfortunately too sleep-deprived to understand even half of what was going on. This is one of the few films I've ever rewatched, since the plot was so complex and addicting to puzzle out. After spending a long night analyzing it, I think it’s self-consistent. I think I really enjoy these cerebral multi-layered plots; it reminds me a bit of unwrapping the onion plots of ‘Us’ or ‘Interstellar’.

### 2021

Watched a lot of weirder movies this year due to my film class.

- **Dune**: 8/10 if you haven't read the book, 9/10 if you have. Really incredible seeing the amount of thought gone into this, and how similar the feelings were when reading the book. I wish I could see [director breakdowns like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoAA0sYkLI0) for every single scene.

- **Shang-Chi**: 7/10. Pretty high for a Marvel movie, good family vibes and really nice to see Marvel giving representation.

- **Churchill**: 5/10. Good acting, but that doesn't really make up for the overly simplictic plot. The movie kind of overplays Chuchill's role and the movie takes too many factual liberties.

- **Invictus**: 6/10. Interesting, and portrayed parts of his leadership that were particularly surprising that I think any leader can learn from. I feel other movies about Mandela will do a better job depicting the harder battles he fought for his country.

- **Kamikaze Girls**: 8/10. I did not expect to like this as much as I did. Was assigned by a film class, but this is just told in such a fresh style that I've never seen any American cinema ever have the creativity for. The only Japanese non-anime film that I've ever seen probably.

- **His Girl Friday**: 8/10. Also surprise how much I enjoyed this. I think this movie set the record for fastest words per minute, and is a hilarious story about yellow journalism in the 1900s.

- **Amelie**: 8/10. This is a classic -- from the color palette to the strange character, to the feeling of clever retribution. Made me fall in love with Yann Tiersen's song Comptine d'un Autre été: L'Après-Midi.

- **The Conversation**: 4/10.

- **Citizen Kane**: 6/10. Funny how much this says about the powerful today.

- **In the Heights**: 8/10. Love me some Lin Manuel Miranda.

- **We Are As Gods**: 10/10. Absolutely incredible, underrated documentary about Steward Brand, "the person that all the people you look up to, look up to." I think hearing his story gave me the freedom to pursue what I want, how I want to. Not sure if it's available online, so [dm me](https://twitter.com/yush_g/) for a copy. Probably favorite of the year.

- **Crazy Rich Asians**: 7/10. Classic.

### 2020

- **Us**: 10/10. Favorite movie of the year. One of those movies with a massive retcon, and spent like 4 hours afterwards analyzing how all the little symbols and scenes actually fit together insanely well and imply super crazy things. The feeling of revalation I got from analyzing this is the feeling I wish English class had been able to convey.

- **Soul**: 10/10. Great character design, message, and feelings. Really loved it, and it came at a particularly well timed point.

- **21**: 8/10. Love me some MIT.

- **Enola Holmes**: 4/10. Standard, nothing particularly interesting about it.

- **Ratatouille**: 10/10. Second time watching this after 5ish years. Feel good.

### 2019

- **Aladdin Live-Action**: 10/10. Great family movie. I am an absolute Aladdin simp.

- **Avengers**: 7/10. I guess as a kid there's some feeling of closuse you want after having seen so many Marvel movies, which is why I keep watching. Nothing particularly interesting about the plot or storytelling, classic superhero stories.

### 2018

- **Psych: The Movie**: 10/10. I'm a Psych simp. Anything Psych I will give a 10/10 gauranteed.

- **The Big Sick**: 9/10. Just completely insane that this was a real story.

- **Inside Out**: 10/10. If you can't tell yet, I'm a Disney simp. Probably my favorite Disney movie.

- **O Brother, Where Art Thou?**: 9/10.

- **Ready Player One**: 8/10. I actually liked this a lot more than most sci-fi snobs, plus it came out before metaverse was memed out of relevance.

## Want To Watch

The notes for these movies are just summaries of what friends have told me about. Approximately ranked with most-want-to-watch at the top.

- **The Secret and Their Eyes (original Spanish version)**: Action thriller with plot intricacies to endlessly discuss. Personally recommended to me due to plot.
- **Shoplifters**: Director is very good (though this is his best), this won a number of international film festivals. Usually recommended for people who liked Parasite.
- **Handmaiden**: Korean, sexual mystery, gripping and edgy themes, strange straightforward romantic movie
- **Portrait of a Lady on Fire**: Well made, 2x recommended to me
- **Black Panther 2**: Was shot at MIT, so I have to see that.
- **PK**: Bollywood movie that seems to be about an alien but is really about something more human?
- **Song of the sea**: Scottish film with Anime vibes
- **Minions 2**: Degenerate childhood nostalgia.
- **Petit Mamam**: French movie, more about feelings than dialogue
- **Yi Yi**: 2000 Taiwanese classic
- **Silent Voice**: Anime with mute girl, touching movie with themes of forgiveness
