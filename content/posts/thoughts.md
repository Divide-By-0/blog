## Musings

These are just extracts of the most interesting thoughts from conversations I have, or articles I read, or things I languidly think about. Hopefully this can serve as a place to record my response to things to both re-evaluate later and invite public discussion on to correct my takeaways, so I'd love hearing any feedback or related ideas! Title inpsired by the incredible [rabbitholeathon](https://www.rabbitholeathon.com/).

In an ideal world, I would both survey my opinion on the topic before the reading, and after the reading, and maybe make some concrete predictions or somehow stake my opinions? But there isn't a super easy way to do this right now. Maybe staking some bounties here or setting up a manifolds market folder for myself would work well? Open to suggestions. I will probably start a similar page for the books I read soon, but for now they are on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123131170-aayush-gupta).

This alive doc will be updated every time I feel the desire to pen a thought.

## Thoughts from articles

- Popularized by Westworld, is [The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/) reasonable?
  - I got curious about this after the clear impact this book had on Westworld. While the core theory isn't really falsifiable (i.e. we can't really confirm or deny there may be some species that thinks bicamerally, or some branch of ancient humans may have thought like this), I think it is very interesting and thought provoking. There can be scientific disagreement over subpoints (maybe it's not exactly left vs right brain or [maybe it is](https://www.julianjaynes.org/blog/julian-jaynes-theory/neuroscience-confirms-julian-jaynes-neurological-model/), maybe it's related to some subset of schizophrenia cases or maybe it's not, maybe there's evidence from Bronze age and older literature or maybe that's just how they wrote, maybe auditory hallucinations are evidence of bicamerality or maybe they are drug induced or just tools of manipulation) -- while they are all interesting to ask and wonder about, they seem just as unknowable as the core thesis. I think it's a compelling hypothesis for why so many earlier societies were far more god-centric than we are, but maybe that belief stems from lack of broad scientific understanding. Regardless, it is a cool theory that I think more folks should know.
- Can feral children talk to animals? And if they then learn a human language, can they act as a translator?
  - There are so many [examples of such children](https://cherrydeck.com/blog/the-shocking-stories-of-feral-children/) but there don't seem to be a ton of data from the rehabilitated kids about their ability to "speak" the animal language, just calls as far as I can tell. Interspecies communication is fascinating to me -- reminiscent of Westworld or ChatGPT, if we can have cogent conversations with an animal made of flesh and neurons, what is the threshold at which we can be sure that they are conscious and self-aware? Animals seem to have some form of default mode network in their brain, but it's unclear if it's the same as it is in humans (in humans, this brain part is thought to be responsible for a sense of self or ego, and allows self-reflection and spontaneous thoughts). There seems to be a number of examples of [human-dolphin communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93animal_communication#Lilly) via a whistle pidgin with 30ish sounds.
- Dreams are the one of the [anti-memetics](https://www.amazon.com/There-No-Antimemetics-Division-qntm/dp/B0915M7T61) that we know about, not the weakest but also not insanely strong. What are the others, and can we arm ourselves to understand them better?
  - From an [interview with qntm](https://signalsfromtheedge.org/author-interview-qntm-there-is-no-antimemetics-division) himself, `Things like dirty secrets, taboos, passwords, dreams, politically inconvenient historical facts, complex equations, boring tax code, injunctions and super-injunctions. I call these difficult-to-share ideas “antimemes”.`. For some of these (boring tax code), there are specialists that it is almost always better to defer to. Other things like dirty secrets and taboos intrigue us even from early childhood. Complex equations can give you insane predictive superpowers, but they take intense focus to shield against their anti-meme powers. I haven't dug into the world of super injunctions, but I bet theres a treasure trove down there.
  - Framing math in terms of fighting antimemes could be awesome for education.
- Are there memetics classes? Inspired again by [qntm's interviews](https://signalsfromtheedge.org/author-interview-qntm-there-is-no-antimemetics-division).
  - Memetics is kind of sort of not really a pseudoscientific field. I bet it would be a fascinating class though even just from a historical perspective, and I would absolutely take one. Is there any such class online? If anyone knows, I'd love to hear. Maybe searching through the [syllabus galaxy](https://galaxy.opensyllabus.org/) could help. Maybe I/someone else can teach an IAP class on it if we find useful literature to teach from?
- [Rosenhan Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment)
  - An 9 person experiment from '73, in which a few folks feigned hallucinations to enter mental institutions -- after immediately saying those symptoms disappeared, they were still forced to admit to schizophrenia, take medication, and admit to having a mental illness. Even funnier was the followup, in which a hospital invited Rosenhan to send pseudopatients to be weeded out. They suspected 41/193, but Rosenhan sent none. I am skeptical of the validity of the 9 person experiment, because pretending to have a mental illness should not be surprised when diagnosed as that. The followup, while more curious, also doesn't seem to imply the conclusion most seem to have taken: they don't quite prove that mental health is overdiagnosed (while this is almost certainly true). The hospital was ID'ing folks that seem like they might be faking, not trying to identify folks who don't have mental disorders. Regardless, I think the state of diagnosis and treatment is completely fucked and the result of decomissioning such hospitals is good -- I think effective therapy and humane treatment, rather than arbitrary labels, will make more of a difference than any existing drug (except maybe psychadelics).
- [Do antibiotics being fed to livestock matter?](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/12/13/are-farm-antibiotics-destroying-our-health/)
  - This article does a great job of breaking down the problem and it's history for a layperson. I'm pretty convinced that naked antibiotics are very harmful, but I'm not sure if subdermal administration is sufficient for humans as well, or if the mechanism of action requires consumption, or if balancing it with opposite probiotics is sufficientlly palliative.

## Thoughts from conversations

- Why aren't there more fission advocacy groups and individuals deeply devoted to proving to the public that fission is now completely safe?
  - A friend brough up the good point that nuclear fission has not proliferated partially due to arms controls laws in case the nuclear capability is misappropriated, but mostly due to public perception and fear of meltdown. This fear is no longer reasonable given the leaps and bounds in fuel tech that cannot physically meltdown and way better designs. A group devoted to public informing and advocacy could be quite interesting, or even a lone wolf Varoufakis-type figure for fission.
- What is a videogame design that cannot be botted?
  - This question is pretty important as AI gets more and more powerful, scripting becomes easier and easier, and games add assets that have massive real economic value. A friend asked me this but we could only think of one such function together. Would be curious to hear what other folks can cook up from first principles.
- Experiencing local culture
  - I think my optimal travel experience would be something [like being a part of cool traditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSs0o7DrHeg). I've put together some [travel recs](https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/travel/) with novelty in mind, but have yet to have any experiences like the former.
- Will Project CETI lead to cargo cultism in whales?
  - A system of belief in which a less tech advanced society is contacted by a more advanced society, and the less advanced society resorts to ineffective means like prayer to try to bring the more advanced society to bring more goods, like guns. Interesting to wonder if this will be a possible fear with interspecies communication projects, like [humans aiming to talk with whales](https://common.earth/project-ceti).
