- Earlier this year, we released zk email; this primitive works on emails already in your inbox. This is most useful for proofs of identity or past actions (transactions).
- However, when users and protocols are sending emails, the UI can be a lot more intuitive by cc'ing the prover directly. So the interface doesn't require scary sign-ins or drag-and-dropped emails.
- This can cause sent emails to trigger on-chain transactions directly.

## How it Works

## Innovations

## Decentralization

## Mainnet Demo

Thanks to Sora, Aayush, Saleel, Rasul, and Elo for making this possible, PSE (Tyler and Barry) who helped fund this tech, and Y Academy and PSE Security for auditing the dependencies and the protocol respectively. Lots of other thanks to Ana, Vivek, Josef, George, and the ZKP2P team for taking this technology across the mainnet line.
