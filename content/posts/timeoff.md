I hear again and again that people don't know what to do when they graduate and feel scattered and lost, and at one point in time I felt that too -- I'd like to think I worked my way out of that instead of succumbing to some convenient option available to me, and I want to make some of my thoughts during that time available for others to hopefully take something away from.

At the beginning of this period, I was lost, a bit depressed, and had no idea what I wanted to do. I had this heavy sense of expectation, that I had to do something big, and I wanted to do it now, and I was always set up for a story like that but I just couldn't quite find the right thing to do it with. It was a strange mismash of emotions combined with confusion, and I more or less spent months living a frustrated existence, made worse by worsening allergies, COVID isolation during a Boston winter, and a bad co-founder breakup filled with regrets of all kinds.

Over the course of several months were things, I went through my conviction re-awakening, primarily through conversations with respected mentors that went a long way in straightening out the weird mental thought patterns I had that locked me in this local maxima. I describe [most of those conversations here](https://blog.aayushg.com/conviction/) and [most of my final takeaways here](https://blog.aayushg.com/fake_conviction/). I was initially scared of these transitions -- _won't I lose my ambition if I fix the cognitive dissonances that lead to them? the most successful people are all a little fucked up anyways right?_ -- but I think the person that emerged is in fact far more likely to have their goals correspond to their actions in a sustainable way, which makes those outcomes more likely, not less.

I recommend reading those conviction posts before reading the following linked posts one, as it provides the main thought patterns that grounded my exploration during these 6 months. After understanding what led to conviction, I still needed to practically apply that and go experience different things and actually gain opinionated conviction, albeit now without pressure or expectations. So I proceeded to do what I recommend everyone does; I took the next 6 months off and proceeded to (strategically) fuck around and find out. I think such a period is highly underrated pre-college, and even more underrated post-college. Periods of transition require a strong sense of self-identity to avoid falling into memetic traps in confusion, and time off is the strongest way to build your own opinions.

Around this time, I decided to anonymously write to provide myself some clarity (and maybe others in the future), which I [briefly elaborate on here](https://yushg.substack.com/p/coming-soon?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2). After publishing one post and realizing no one reads any of this by default, I just attached a pretty obvious pseudonym and started publishing under my almost-real name. I published 3 total posts about 5 total months of time, including [Jan](https://yushg.substack.com/p/the-last-month), [Feb-March](https://yushg.substack.com/p/the-last-two-months), and [April-May](https://yushg.substack.com/p/aprilmay-2022). This post serves to contextualize them, but they are the main focus and I recommend reading them to get a concrete sense of what that might look like.

I had fun, read books, and traveled. But mostly I explored projects and ideas I thought were interesting that most other people didn't seem to care about, read a good chunk of the books that were recommended to me over the last 6 months, wrote my goals, and massively expanded the scope of classes I tried in school and evaluated from first principles. I think such a period of self-discovery marked itself as more unique than any of my previous periods in school due to the variety of ways I fully indulged and harnessed my ADHD, and did everything I did solely due to curiosity and due to nothing else (not learning, not planning for the future, and not due to some vague expecatation). I'm glad I actually documented it, so hopefully those posts can give folks a sense of orientation. They helped me build foundations and interests that now, 3 years later, I realize have completely shaped my trajectory and interests in a way that I am proud of.

<!-- Add answer to how I feel about it -- what do I think about it looking back? High level how I felt is missing. I should add more about how I gained conviction specifically. -->

<!-- I rely on the links too heavily and I outsource too much; it's too jarring since I don't deliver any content. I don't describe what I did in the FAFO but link them 3 paragraphs later instead. Most people won't follow the links so you need to give context much better. Reorder since I say what I did then give context way later. Be intentional about the chronology so it's consistent. Timeline was confusing since that wasn't how it happened -- I portrary it as I got the conviction first, but I should make it clear that I just got the principles first. Put the conviction summary later down so that people can follow it -- don't have to rehash, just be clear that it is there. -->
