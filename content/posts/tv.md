---

Based on similar movie rec doc. It's hard to find a curated list of shows that I or my friends would like. I've tried to get my shows from Netflix before, or my friends -- even then, it's hard to isolate why people like specific shows with only spoiler-free reviews. Personal recommendations are rare and treasured, and I wish there was a place that all my friends put their favorite shows up so I could steal from that list instead. I'm trying to get more into anime as well! I honestly don't watch very many shows, and when I do I am really slow at like 1 episode per week: it took me almost 1.5 years to finish Bojack Horseman.

Storytelling simp is pretty lossy and inaccurate representation of this list. I generally love any shows that have really complex characters, good humor, and make me see something in a different light. I prefer complex plots that take focus to fully understand or make you feel a ton of emotions, or have you sniff out lots of little clues that the animators/directors plant. I think this list is pretty broadly recommendable, but specifically I think folks who care more about characters than action will particularly love this list. I try not to include any spoilers, but more of a broadstrokes review. This list is largely inspired by [Nick Sweeting's similar list](https://docs.sweeting.me/s/movies-to-watch#Mindfuck) and [Max Langenkamp's](https://maxlangenkamp.me/). If you have any recs for me having looked at this list, I'd love to hear them -- you can dm me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yush_g/)! To calibrate, anything 8 or above means I highly recommend that others watch it, and 10 is a must-watch. ⭐ My top show of the year is marked in stars ⭐. I tend to stop shows I don't like in the middle, so expect all shows under 8 stars to only be reflective of the first part of the show, and shows 9 or 10 stars to be about the whole show.

### 2023

This year I've basically exclusively watched anime, compared to almost none before.

- **Attack on Titan**: 6/10 so far. I watched the first few episodes and found the characters alright, but the focus on war, gore, and one dimensional villians a bit offputting. After hearing [the same studio that made Jujutsu Kaisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPPA) animated Season 4 though and a lot of friends say it is definitively not about the villians, I may give it another shot. While I understand that characters have no choice but to live in this world and are doing their best given the situation, I didn't like how the characters are primarily motivated via standard pro-war rhetoric, or the ridiculously large number of named characters that I can't keep track of. The power dynamics and coordination of large military organizations was actually quite interesting, but that only began halfway through the season -- when the stakes are always death and it focuses so much on gore, it's numbing and hard for me to want to watch. I found [this analysis with S1 spoilers only](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2f1tte/attack_on_titan_analysis_spoilers/) of season 1 pretty fun to read.

- ⭐ **Jujutsu Kaisen** ⭐: 10/10. I initially didn't watch this show because I thought it was about martial arts from the title. I was extremely wrong -- jujutsu roughly literally translates as "gentle technique", and means general unarmed combat: the show has some fighting, but it's not really about that. The villians are well justified and engaging, the characters are extremely complex and evolve in very anti-trope ways, and the plot is insanely well done. The animation is also incredible, and I love that the writers and animators are massive memers: there are chibi-style cut scenes to exaggerate reactions that are hilarious, and after-credit joke scenes that are basically memes. The [second opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBQwlV5Wtas) is also now probably my favorite Japanese song. I wish there were more spoiler-free discussions or youtube analyses for each episode, though I found [Reddit's episode threads](https://www.reddit.com/comments/j412g2) decent.

- **Made in Abyss**: 7/10 first season. This anime seems to be [Gwerns favorite anime](https://gwern.net/review/anime) and seemed promising; the premise and world building of the first episode felt really fascinating to me, and it's only 13 episodes. However, as I watched the next 6 or so episodes, I thought the pacing was pretty poor: it was simultaneously too fast to give time to each place, and too slow to develop major plot points. Too much time was spent on the landscape, and too little on the lore or the history. In addition, the characters were pretty simple and one-dimensional, and the villians weren't particularlly cunning or interesting.

I really liked the season 1 finale, but imo it wasn't worth 9 episodes of buildup. The two movies (journeys dawn and wandering twilight) cut a lot of the crappy slow plots out, added some fun scenes, and seem overall better. I'd recommend just watching the movies piecemeal over the anime. I think if you prefer pretty worldbuilding to fighting scenes and are willing to wait for plot, only then it's a good fit.

- **Code Geass**: Maybe 6/10 for the first 5 episodes. The villianization of invaders is pretty one sided, the main character seems to win no matter what, and I don't like the animation style much or lack of clearly developed characters and backstory. The school scenes are alright though.

### 2022

- **Westworld** 10/10 for Season 1. The world building and meta world building is absolutely insane -- both the out west parts and the futuristic parts. It delves really deep into some very interesting consciousness theories, which I've commented on [a bit more in my other posts](https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/questions#thoughts-from-articles). They slyly slip in a bunch of fun thought experiments about consciousness and AI that are remarkably thought provoking and unique -- Jonathan Nolan clearly dug deep for material. The characters are dynamic and multifaceted, and the plot is surprising and well done.

- **Sword Art Online**: 8/10 for Season 1. A metaverse concept that was pretty novel for it's time, the protagonists are entertaining, and the the romance is heartwarming. Probably aimed at middle or high schoolers, but I really enjoyed it nevertheless and would recommend it as an intro anime. Heard the second season was mediocre so decided to try others.ers

- ⭐ **Bojack Horseman** ⭐: 10/10. It's nominally the best show around about depression, but it's so well done that I couldn't really tell. I found the titular character to be both repulsive and incredibly relatable: a remarkable mirror on myself that I've never seen so well done in media. The characters are all astoundingly complex and deal with realistic problems that show who they deeply are, and the anthropomorphic characters drive focus to chracter traits closer to people's cores.

### 2021

- ⭐ **Rick and Morty** ⭐: 10/10. This is an absolute classic - Dan Harmon is a story and plot genius, and the sci-fi-esque plots are hilarious, cynical, and anti-tropey. I cannot recommend this highly enough; I have consumed basically all of the interviews and related spinoff shorts I could find on YouTube at this point. The few episodes that kicked off the second half of Season 5 are probably better skipped, but other than that I think most episodes are absolute bangers.

### 2020

- ⭐ **Master of None** ⭐: 10/10. Aziz Ansari is a genius: this show is an incredible mix of comedy and personal reflection; it's a really incredible set of stories about being a mid 20s-something person in New York: the disgust of parts of the lifestyle, the confict around actions that are maybe ethical and maybe not, and all of the small awkward moments in life that everyone has but no one acknowledges.

## Want to Watch

The notes for these movies are just summaries of what friends/Reddit have told me about. Approximately ranked with most-want-to-watch at the top.

- **Your Lie in April**: Highly recommended dramatic romance
- **Violet Evergarden**: "the most beautiful animation out of any that I've seen." - My friend Ray. Unforunately, I really don't like war plots, so it's not high on the list.
- **Bocchi the Rock**: This is one of the most popular animes in my Japanese friend's Tokyo group, about an anxious-avoidant gradeschool girl who's really good at guitar, and has to reconcile the social needs of being in a band with her natural introversion.
- **Stein's Gate**: Apparently this is a really good one about a time travelling microwave (seems a little absurd to me, but I'm willing to give it a shot) -- a friend said this is the anime he most wishes he could rewatch with fresh eyes.
- **Demon Slayer**: The manifestation of curses is very similar to Jujutsu Kaisen, as is the duality of the main character. Seems like a curious one to try out, but many people say that it's inferior to Jujutsu Kaisen.
- **Hormiya**: One season, 13 episode anime about a high school romance. Best Romance of the year in 6th annual Crunchyroll awards.
- **Tatami Galaxy**: Seems to explore the disllusionment of exploring alternate school lives. Critically acclaimed with exaggerated style and absurd dark comedy, 11 episodes.
