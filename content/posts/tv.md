Based on similar movie rec doc. It's hard to find a curated list of shows that I or my friends would like. I've tried to get my shows from Netflix before, or my friends -- even then, it's hard to isolate why people like specific shows with only spoiler-free reviews. Personal recommendations are rare and treasured, and I wish there was a place that all my friends put their favorite shows up so I could steal from that list instead. I'm trying to get more into anime as well! I honestly don't watch very many shows, and when I do I am really slow at like 1 episode per week: it took me almost 1.5 years to finish Bojack Horseman.

Storytelling simp is pretty lossy and inaccurate representation of this list. I generally love any shows that have really complex characters, good humor, and make me see something in a different light. I prefer complex plots that take focus to fully understand or make you feel a ton of emotions, or have you sniff out lots of little clues that the animators/directors plant. I think this list is pretty broadly recommendable, but specifically I think folks who care more about characters than action will particularly love this list. I try not to include any spoilers, but more of a broadstrokes review. This list is largely inspired by [Nick Sweeting's similar list](https://docs.sweeting.me/s/movies-to-watch#Mindfuck) and [Max Langenkamp's](https://maxlangenkamp.me/). If you have any recs for me having looked at this list, I'd love to hear them -- you can dm me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yush_g/)! To calibrate, anything 8 or above means I highly recommend that others watch it, and 10 is a must-watch. ⭐ My top show of the year is marked in stars ⭐. I tend to stop shows I don't like in the middle, so expect all shows under 8 stars to only be reflective of the first part of the show, and shows 9 or 10 stars to be about the whole show.

## Previous

### 2023

- ⭐ **Jujutsu Kaisen** ⭐: 10/10. I initially didn't watch this show because I thought it was about martial arts from the title. I was extremely wrong -- jujutsu roughly literally translates as "gentle technique", and means general unarmed combat: the show has some fighting, but it's not really about that. The villians are well justified and engaging, the characters are extremely complex and evolve in very anti-trope ways, and the plot is insanely well done. The animation is also incredible, and I love that the writers and animators are massive memers: there are chibi-style cut scenes to exaggerate reactions that are hilarious, and after-credit joke scenes that are basically memes. The [second opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBQwlV5Wtas) is also now probably my favorite Japanese song. I wish there were more spoiler-free discussion places for each episode, though I found [Reddit's episode threads](https://www.reddit.com/comments/j412g2) decent.

- **Made in Abyss**: 7/10. This anime seems to be [Gwerns favorite anime](https://gwern.net/review/anime) and seemed promising; the premise and world building of the first episode felt really fascinating to me, and it's only 13 episodes. However, as I watched the next 6 or so episodes, I thought the pacing was pretty poor: it was simultaneously too fast to give time to each place, and too slow to develop major plot points. In addition, the characters were pretty simple and one-dimensional, and the villians weren't particularlly cunning or interesting. Perhaps it gets better in the second half, but I likely won't find out.

- **Attack on Titan**: ???. I watched the first episode and found the characters interesting, but the focus on war, gore, and one dimensional villians a bit offputting. After hearing [the same studio that made Jujutsu Kaisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPPA) animated Season 4 though and a lot of friends say it is definitively not about the villians, I may give it another shot.

- **Code Geass**: ???. Maybe 6/10 for the first 5 episodes. The villianization of invaders is pretty one sided, the main character seems to win no matter what, and I don't like the animation style much or lack of clearly developed characters and backstory. The school scenes are alright though.

### 2022

- ⭐ **Bojack Horseman** ⭐: 10/10. It's nominally the best show around about depression, but it's so well done that I couldn't really tell. I found the titular character to be both repulsive and incredibly relatable: a remarkable mirror on myself that I've never seen so well done in media. The characters are all complex, and the anthropomorphic characters drive focus to chracter traits closer to people's cores.

### 2020

- ⭐ **Master of None** ⭐: 10/10. Aziz Ansari is a genius: this show is an incredible mix of comedy and personal reflection; it's a really incredible set of stories about being a mid 20s-something person in New York: the disgust of parts of the lifestyle, the confict around actions that are maybe ethical and maybe not, and all of the small awkward moments in life that everyone has but no one acknowledges.
