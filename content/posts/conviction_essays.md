A friend a few years back to me said, "Conviction is the scarcest resource, not time." It's stuck with me, and I've developed a life philosophy around it. I struggle to write about it (though it's very easy for me to talk about it in a Q&A format), but these are a few early cracks I had at essays and/or bullet point notes. I'm gonna try to approach this in a map vs territory kind of way: I point at a map and say look, that's the shape of that thing, and hopefully it's enough for you to fill in what I'm trying to convey yourself. Part 2 in a multiseries blog post about conviction.

## How to (and How Not To) Get Conviction

<!-- TODO: Add examples to ways to get conviction  -->

- Motivation
  - The person who does every action and speaks every word the successful person did and spoke, may have the same outcome, but will not emerge with the same emotional consistency. They will not have the curiosity to build off what they did towards the future, or the enduring satisfaction that they followed what they believed in. They might have the money, but not the internal wealth or the long term means to create more and give the right advice.
- Conviction
  - Ways to get conviction
    - **Media**
      - Reading books gives you conviction in certain ideas – that's why it's important to choose only the authors that are experts in their fields, who have fought the fights and been through the trials and tribulations.
      - Rereading/rewatching renews conviction as well. I used to be opposed to this, because I consumed content for the excitement of unknown stories, and the stories weren't as novel the second time around. But if watching something gave you conviction in an idea, chances are that conviction will fade without constant rebuffing – and you really do get a chance to think about deeper artistic details that aren't at the apex of the foreground.
    - **Environment**
      - A blog, whiteboard, and excited people around you are the biggest motivators. Letting thoughts marinate in your head in a vacuum is risky, I've found – it leads to too many cases where you feel like you obtained conviction, but in reality you're standing on shaky logical ground. Write your convictions down, test them by sharing them with people, and surround yourself by others who aren't content with settling.
      - Though I loved my previous roommates, it was hard to get support for the weird things I was starting to explore budding convictions in: they'd often shoot the whole concept down when we got to something I wasn't sure about, instead of encouraging me to build a stronger foundation on that point. Ultimately, it was healthier for me to separate and find new ones that I vibed with more.
      - If people ask you questions, do your thoughts hold up? This is often easier in physical conversation than online -- online, it's too easy to just not ask any questions.
    - **Momentum**
      - Momentum brings you to a world level, and deepens over time. Put this way: your goal is not "find the perfect topic", but choose a topic that will lead to interesting things, then pursue it with increasing fervor built from reading books in the field and talking to people in the field. This is a nice reframing of commitment, for the commitment-phobes of us.
      - This is how people do one thing for a long time. They just get more and more conviction, and better and better intuitions. Conversely, you do need to do one thing for a while for your conviction to be strong -- you can't just build it in one night.
      - If the reasons for their conviction is ever broken, they either find new equally compelling reasons, or switch.
  - Ways not to get conviction
    - As you mature and learn more, conviction becomes harder. Youthful arrogance is often a quick and easy proxy for conviction, but flawed in exactly that – we are looking for conviction based on truth, not an arrogant delusion of the truth.
    - Originality is a shortcut to conviction, but fake originality is a fake shortcut. If you use someone else's thoughts and delude yourself into thinking non-first-principles thoughts are your own, you're standing on a shaky tower; poking at those thoughts risk collapsing the whole tower. Use other people's thoughts to inform your own, don't copy (see: Steal Like an Artist).
    - Learning theory, as many people go through school doing, can build knowledge. But, it does not build conviction – knowing the theory people already know, will not give you a strong belief in any problem space or narrow field – that comes from experience. Side projects are great for this, or research.
    - There's a story that Musk went to Bezos at the start of Blue Origin, and told him a few plausible-sounding failed ideas, to help him avoid doing the same. Jeff heard, then went ahead and did a lot of the same things – not because he willfully ignored Musk, but because he could trade that time and money for conviction. Giving his best foot to his most promising idea would give him the conviction he gave it a shot, without having to regret not trying. He'd learn the reason it still failed – so the whole team could trek forwards with high-conviction takeaways, confident in the next idea they try. Compare that to the conviction based off of just a whisper from a memelord.
  - Conviction needs sustained excitement
    - Just do things you enjoy or are passionate or curious about. The question, "what about this other thing I could have conviction in?" doesn't apply nearly as strongly; you don't have a good grasp of the field beyond a layman's intuition, you don't have a deep understanding of where to make a difference, and you will never be able to even start fathoming impact in that field till you are beyond experienced.
    - Where does conviction and success come from then? Sustained excitement. That's it. Really being interested in the thing for the sake of the thing, and pursuing it and asking deeper and deeper questions.
    - Try to have conviction on every level of the thing you're doing: inspiration at the 10 year goal, interest in the subject and learning deeper on the 1-3 year time frame, interest in the day to day skills and activities, etc.
  - How to know you have conviction
    - Conviction needs emotional alignment – when doing the thing, you believe you are happiest doing that thing. Alignment seems wishy-washy, so here's a formalism: all your doubts, the ones that happen every second, the ones you think of every few minutes, and the ones every few weeks, at each step, are outweighed by your conviction. You'll always have doubts, but your emotions should still point in the same rough direction.
    - In fact, emotional consistency is necessary and sufficient -- you can skip all the other steps, but be hyper aware of your emotional response to everything and confident in tapping into your own feelings to guide you. My definition of feelings here refers to the kind of "gut" response that your hunter-gatherer brain, having combined all of your goals and desires, expresses through muscle tension or intrusive thoughts.
  - Conviction is a resource
    - It can be "discovered" through aggressive exploration or emotional in-tune-ness, lost as one becomes disillusioned or the original reasons for that conviction no longer hold, and is scarce (but not fixed supply).
    - In a sense, this framing might be too limiting -- conviction is perhaps less a resource, than a narrative. But a powerful narrative you spin around your life, that almost delude you into the extra importance of some specific thing: that narrative is just as arbitrary as any decision or belief you might have -- but it is extremely powerful in directing actions in a consistent and self-boosting manner.

## You Can't Fake Conviction

This was an essay I wrote for a fellowship a few years back. It's a bit more concise than I would prefer, but gets the jist across.

I used to see time as the scarcest resource. As a result, I would optimize at the expense of experience: rushing home without appreciating the subtle satisfaction of ice crunching beneath my shoes, or 2x’ing TV shows without appreciating the nuanced filmography choices. My biggest change was seeing conviction, not time, as the scarce resource. This change came in two ways: by reframing my internal metaphors, and noticing what led to the strongest convictions.

Lakoff and Johnson’s writing helped me uncover the spoken analogies that dominated my thinking and invisibly directed my behavior. For instance, ‘running out’ of time or ‘saving’ time reinforces mental models where time is like money. But what if we conceive of conviction as the primary scarce and finite resource instead? Strong, value-driven reasons to do unique things are rare, and I became obsessed with cultivating it.

As I began to notice conviction around me, I began to name shortcuts I had taken. Real conviction is hard, because easy and fake paths abound. Youthful arrogance isn’t intellectually honest. Grinding on theory is a great way to learn something, but alone can’t impart personal conviction in a single idea. Listening to the chatter on Twitter might spark interest, but these incomplete mental models impart just fleeting moments of belief. Liking and disliking certain things form a set of preferences, but alone aren't enough for a consistent conviction in a specific direction.

To get conviction now, I [read strange books by experts](https://glibert.io/blog/reading/), [learn different fields deeply](https://glibert.io/blog/learn_ml/), and pursue only projects that showcase interesting ideas, inevitably spawning more. I no longer worry about optimizing each second, and feel excitement when I build.

## Optionality Kills Conviction

- On optionality
  - Having read the admissions blogs on articles such as, "look at every class your school offers", how a PhD student found their passion in space systems orientation and navigation (through undergrad classes they liked, could articulate reasons for, a fun research-y experience but with a real system floating out in space, etc).
  - On the blog about pruning paths being essential; choosing not to prune is in itself a choice, and a deadly one.
  - On the blogs mentioning excellent sheep; how many of the kids that go through college do so in a way that is super high achieving when the goals are set externally; set on a path, these kids fly like a fantastically directed arrow.
  - And so colleges pump out people who maintain optionality instead of specializing, who do things and don't know why, but do well at them. People with talents in fields they don't have conviction in. And that's the deadly tradeoff: conviction for optionality.
  - Building talent before having conviction in what you're doing means there are two outcomes: either you find what you have conviction in and you discard a number of those talents, or you stick with your talents, overrule your own internal convictions, and continue to remain "lost" forever. Of course, if you enjoy those talents , then that can totally legitimately factor in to your conviction -- you might have some insight or frustration or ability that does change your internal narrative, and those are totally fine!
  - I've always believed in thinking for yourself from first conclusions and struggled to understand what drove the idiots at my high school, and never could — because nothing drove them. No sense of underlying purpose, no robust mathematical worldview, no desire to talk about any big problems beyond base pleasure from sports and girls.
- Language splices out bad reasons for conviction
  - Communicates subtleties and reasons and things that go beyond the surface level
  - One must believe you can transmit and encode all information in language/imagery — without this, communication breaks down, and meaning in the world is lost. It cannot be transmitted, or understood, or anything. To really make sure your conviction is robust, you better be able to express your convictions through language, not just feeling.
  - The translation into language is often the step where you can identify other people who don't have full conviction as well. Ask them questions, poke and prod till you fully understand what drives them.but ay

## Bad Forms of Conviction

- Seeing my roommate is doing research he's not super jazzed by
  - His eyes don't light up with excitement, it's just "going well"
  - Just wants to learn about ML and how to apply it, so he chose some random prof and field to work with
    - I disagree with this choice: I think to be a real expert and develop this compounding passion, you have to choose something that excites you and you're curious about, and keep asking questions.
    - You can't love doing a thing because you like the tools involved: you have to be curious about the thing itself, or else you are building knowledge in a field you will struggle to push yourself every day in.
- The desire to be surprising, or desire to be impressive
  - You can't let this desire to surprise people overwhelm your necessity to stay true to yourself
  - In fact, you shouldn't let other people's expectations determine anything. Not your parents, not your friends, just you. That's a lot harder, since then your opinions stand fully from a tree of your own creation -- it requires real intellectual honesty first, and confidence in that intellectual honesty second.
  - Many important things don't start off sexy. Computers started off as some esoteric military calculator, blockchains started off as drug dealer money, Mr. Beast was just another guy in his basement.
  - Don't let yourself be the final season of Game of Thrones: a victim of expectations, forced to be "surprising", and cocky off of their previous successes.
- Just "doing"
  - Who is the thinker and the doer in your role? The distinction between the [cook vs the chef](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) is critical -- if you don't yet see this dichotomy or think it's important, you are likely already the victim.
  - You want to be the thinker, but that takes knowledge of the why and the theory and the high level
  - At the same time, still need to be highly technical to get it done when no one else can -- doing is important but not the most important.
- Misunderstanding Musk
  - If you don't understand his drive for learning about space (i.e. reaching out to Cantrell, reading the 4 fat textbooks first, making himself the expert), then you won't understand what led to his conviction and talent (say what you will about his personality, but those two are undeniable)
  - Doing something without first developing a deep understanding is like jumping down a rabbit hole with low confidence
