Research project we did using focused ultrasound to stimulate the scent-processing brain regions in the olfactory bulb directly. The team reliably produced distinct scents such as campfire burn, fresh air, garbage, and ozone-like sensations. This work explores the potential for non-invasive scent modulation through the olfactory system, which could one day serve as a high-dimensional channel for writing directly into the brain.
