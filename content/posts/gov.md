As governments become increasingly skeptical of and take action against crypto, I think it's important to lay out a path forwards for how one might remain optimistic about the space. My opinions on the state of the government in crypto, how I think about how crypto can work with governments in ways that do not undermine the ideals nor insert backdoors, and building tech that may be banned by governments. Note that I am not an expert, this is mostly distilling information from conversations with people much smarter than I.

Past Interactions with Government
- The NSA is notorious for spending billions of dollars [tapping phone lines](https://www.google.com/search?q=wired.com+phone+line+tap+jail+nsa) and [refusing to defend those who do not comply](https://www.wired.com/2007/11/feds-invoke-sec/), and inserting [backdoors into PRNGs](https://www.wired.com/2007/11/securitymatters-1115/) and who knows what other standards.
- Regarding the complex moral question over whether stronger cryptography is more important, or national security is more important, most arguments for the former seem a bit idealistic to me (you still want to avoid extremely morally bad things from happening if you can), and most arguments for the latter also seem a bit idealistic on the government's role -- usually these push for backdoors in cryptography, or a complete discarding of privacy in favor of delegating decision making power to the government.

A Middle Ground
- I think there is a middle ground, and many companies are rightly waking up to it. [Apple's CSAM](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-scanning-heat-initiative-letter/) was one corporate attempt to toe the balance, but I wager that they did not have strong enough cryptographic advances to make this sytem work while not leaking any user data.

Inspired by discussions with Maya Caddle, Arjun R, and convincing my dad that what I work on is not useless.
